# Hunter Training

## Fastest Route to 99:

Full graceful provides a 5% boost to many creatures.

**Passive XP + seeds**   
`+birdhouse` / `+bh`   
You can craft birdhouses and clockwork with the `+craft` command. You need at least 4 birdhouses for a trip.  
**Optimal route for EHP hunter & fishing**   
`+aerialfish / +aerial` \(from 35 hunter and 45 fishing\)

**Optimal route for active hunter XP**  
_Numbers may not be accurate if you're unlucky with RNG_  
`+hunt 23 polar kebbit` \(to 7+\)  
`+hunt feldip weasel` \(to 16+\)  
`+hunt ruby harvest` \(to 25+\) \(hunt 20 more if needed\)  
`+hunt 200 sapphire glacialis` \(to 29+\)  
`+hunt swamp lizard` \(to 43\)  
`+hunt spotted kebbit` \(to 57\)  
`+hunt dark kebbit` \(to 60\)  
`+hunt red salamander` \(to 67\)  
`+hunt black salamander` \(to 73\)  
`+hunt black chinchompa` \(to 99\)  


### Additional Information:

If you wish to avoid using brews/risking gear, you can alternatively do Red Chinchompas starting at 63.

Herbi is an option at 80 Hunter/31 Herblore, with rates up to 160k xp/hr with staminas, ~125k without.

Another option is Aerial Fishing, requiring 35 Hunter/43 Fishing, which is the best method if you want both 99s.
