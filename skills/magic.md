# Magic \(Non-combat\)

To start off the magic skill, you need to quest to get initial levels. If you had quest point progression before the magic skill, you may already have the starter levels out of the way. All spells require the same levels they require in OSRS. Bolt and jewelry enchanting have variable level requirements depending on what type of object you're trying to enchant, and you can see all of your different options and the levels at which they become unlocked using the `+enchant --items` command. You can also `+cast` a variety of utility spells like teleports, alchemy, and lunar spells like tan leather, stringing and charging jewelry, and plank make. All spells require runes, but you can cut down on the rune cost by equipping an [elemental stave](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Elemental_staves) in your skilling setup, which will provide infinite elemental runes depending on the type of staff you equip.

With the Magic skill, the Fountain of Rune is open for limited use in charging your amulets of glory using the `+chargeglories (quantity)` command. Your minion will do full inventories of 26 glories, and will have a small chance of being PK'd and losing your full inventory. If you have all the stats required for the wilderness elite diary, including the 96 magic requirement, you will have a 3x boost when charging glories. It is **not** recommended to charge amulets of glory without the wilderness elite diary. Charging amulets of glory in this way provides a small chance to give you an amulet of eternal glory, which will never run out of charges.
