### Rooftop Agility
Rooftop agility courses reward the player with marks of grace which can be used to buy pieces of the Graceful outfit, using the command `+create graceful` or `+create graceful <piece>`, and amylase packs using the command `+buy [quantity] amylase pack`, which will give you 100 amylase crystals per amylase pack costing 10 marks of grace each.
