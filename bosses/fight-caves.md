# Fight Caves

### Overview

You can challenge the Fight Caves and TzTok-Jad to receive a fire cape, tokkul, and the TzRek-Jad pet using the `+fightcaves` command. Better range gear will reduce the time each attempt takes at a rate of roughly 1% per 5 attack value, as will total Jad kc.   
You can equip your best ranged gear with the autoequip command `+autoequip range attack ranged`  
The number of total attempts you have made will determine your chances of killing Jad when he is reached.  
You can make 4 dose potions from 3, 2, and 1 dose drops using the `+decant` command. Should you fail before the final wave, some of your potions will be refunded.

* +160 range bonus equipped to your range gear setup.
* 43 prayer 
* 10x Prayer Potion \(4\), 4x Super Restore \(4\) and 6x Saradomin Brew \(4\) per attempt.
* Saradomin Godsword equipped in melee gear setup will reduce your chances of dying before Jad by 4%.

If you have extra fire capes, you can gamble them for an additional roll at the TzRek-Jad pet using the `+capegamble` command.

Tokkul can be spent using the `+tokkulshop` command.
