# Chambers of Xeric \(Raids\)

Welcome to **The Chambers of Xeric**.  __

The raids are tough but can give you some highly sought after and valuable rewards, such as the Twisted Bow or even the Metamorphic Dust.

**Requirements** 

Base 80 Combat stats and 70 Prayer. 55 Farming and 78 Herblore are also required if you intend to do solos, if you only intend to mass for your kills, as long as a member of your party meets those requirements you will not need to have them.

It is highly recommended that you have the best possible Melee, Range and Mage gear you can acquire and to equip them in their respective setups.  You can still participate with less than the best gear but you will be more likely to receive less points than somebody with max gear as well as making your times slower the worse your gear is.  

Make sure to have your stamina potions, saradomin brews and super restores ready as you will need them.  When you are first starting out you will be using 7 saradomin brews, 4 super restores and 1 stamina potion per mass, these numbers will be decreasing as your KC gets higher, excluding the stamina potion. For solos you will start out using the same amount of brews and restores but will now also be using 2 stamina's per raid.

**Finding a Raid Team**

Within the discord you will find dedicated channels where you can talk, do normal raids or do cm raids.  For chatting, asking for help with your gear score you can talk in `#raids-general-anim`, for challenge mode raids, solo or mass its recommended that you use `#raids-mass-cm` _****_and for regular raids its recommended that you use `#raids-mass-regular.` Please keep in mind that these are just recommendations, you are not restricted to these channels in order to participate in raiding, it is only recommended as finding a group would be much easier.  

**Getting Started**

There are a few things that need to be prefaced before you get started.  To view your KC, unique's, points per unique and how many total points you've gotten you will be using the command `+raid.`  From there you can either solo a raid which will require you to be at least 50 kc or you can mass a raid which you can do at 1 kc.  For this you will be doing `+raid solo` for normal's,  and to mass a raid you will be doing `+raid mass` for normal's.  In order to start a mass your team must have at least 2 people and will automatically start at 15, among the members of that mass at least one person must have 55 farming and 78 herblore or the mass will not start.  

**Scaling**

You will find that raids will get significantly faster based on how many KC your team has as a whole, the amount of members in the raid, and the gear scores of each member in your raid, 15 members being the best for points and by that logic purples and 9 being the best for speed and more raids.  There are certain items that give a hidden boost to speed that do not need to be equipped and will work from your bank, Twisted Bow gives a 10% Boost or Dragon Hunter Crossbow gives a 5% boost if you don't have a Tbow.  Dragon Warhammer gives a 5% boost or BGS gives a 2.5% boost if you do not have a DWH.  

**Loot**

You get all the same items you do as in game.  Ranging from Dark Relics to Torn prayer scrolls to every unique offered including each variation of pet that would normally only be obtainable through using a Metamorphic dust on your Olmlet to change its form.  These unique pets are only obtainable from Challenge Mode raids after you have received the Metamorphic Dust.  If someone in your raid gets a purple \(unique, valuable reward\), the loot message will be spoilered and will be signified that a valuable drop has been received with a purple square in front of the spoiler message and announced in the `#notifications` channel \(not including prayer scrolls\).  It is possible to die in your raid and will decrease your points and by effect decreasing your chance to receive a drop slightly, deaths being marked by a skull, the more skulls, the more deaths

Disclaimer: At early KC's you are very likely to have sub 1k points and 2 or more deaths as your minion is not very experienced at raids and does not know what to do.
