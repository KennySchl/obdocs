# Challenge Mode

Welcome to **The Chambers of Xeric: Challenge Mode**

You have conquered the Chambers of Xeric, or so you think.  

**Requirements**

The Challenge Mode version of the Chambers of Xeric is significantly more difficult and thus has harder requirements.

* 200 Normal KC
* Twisted Bow or DHCB for Masses
* Twisted Bow for Solos

**Finding a Raid Team**

For Challenge Mode raids you will be primarily looking in `#raids-mass-cm` or if you have a Twisted Bow you can start doing solos immediately at 200 KC which you can do in your own server or in the cm mass channel.  If you don't have a Twisted Bow but you do have a DHCB you will still be able to participate in CMs just only doing masses until you obtain a Twisted Bow.  To do this you will be doing `+raid mass --cm`, or joining a mass that has already been started from doing the command listed.

**Getting Started**

Similarly to before you will check your KC, points and other stats using `+raid`, but now you will also start to see your kc go up for Challenge Mode, it will start to look like this.

**Scaling**

Challenge Mode raids scale a little bit differently compared to Normal raids and that's to keep them challenging.  The raids will still get faster based on gear and KC with your minion reaching the maximum point boost by 100 Challenge mode kc as well as reaching time to obtain Dust or Kits by 50kc for Solos or 75kc for Masses and Maximum time boost at 75kc for Solos.  You will also find that you will be using the same amount of brews/restores and stamina's as you were using when you stopped doing normal raids at 200kc.

**Loot**

Now that you are in Challenge Mode you will start to see more drops unique to this version of the Chambers.  You will still be seeing the Purple square for the Normal unique drops such as Twisted bow or a Prayer scroll, but you will also now be seeing a purple square for the Metamorphic dust pets that drop separately after you have received the dust.  If you see a Blue square that means you or another member has received the Metamorphic dust and now have a chance per raid to receive the Morphed pets. A Green square means somebody has received a Twisted Ancestral Kit that can be added to ancestral pieces to make them Twisted.  It is possible to receive more than one unique drop at a time.
