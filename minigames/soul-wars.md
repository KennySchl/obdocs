# Soul Wars

You can start a soul wars game with the `+sw` command. Soul war is primarily played to gain zeal points in order to imbue items such as rings and the slayer helmet. It also has some other unique rewards.

### Commands

`+sw` - Start a game of soul wars.  
`+sw imbue NameOfItem` - Imbues an item.  
`+sw buy NameOfItem` - Buys an item from the soul wars reward shop.

Currently the only way to check how many points you have is to attempt to buy an item you don't have enough points for. The "Red soul cape" is a good one as this costs 2500 points, be warned if you have enough points you will buy the item. A future update will improve this.

### Buyables

| :--- | :--- |
