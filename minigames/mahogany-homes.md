# Mahogany Homes

Mahogany Homes is the construction minigame and it provides more xp per plank as well as some rewards which will improve your construction experience. To start a contract, use the `+mh build` command. Beginner contracts are available from level 1 to level 19, award 2 points per contract, and use normal planks. Novice contracts are available from level 20 to level 49, award 3 points per contract, and use oak planks. Adept contracts are available from level 50 to level 69, award 4 points per contract, and use teak planks. Expert contracts are available at level 70, award 5 points per contract, and use mahogany planks. All contracts use a random amount of steel bars and planks scaling with the number of contracts you are completing in a trip. The points gained from this minigame can be spent on a variety of items which will help train construction, provide you construction resources, fill your collection log, or are simply cosmetic. You can buy these items with the `+mh buy <item>` command.
