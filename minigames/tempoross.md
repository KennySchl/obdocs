# Tempoross

 With at least 35 Fishing, you can send your minion out with `+tempoross` \(or `+temp`/`+ross`\). 

All rewards are dropped as your minion returns, no need to fish the reward pool. 

Spirit angler can be acquired with `+create`, but provides no additional boost over normal anglers. 

Important boosts: Crystal harpoon for XP, Infernal Harpoon for rewards. Both need to be equipped in your skilling gear. Dragon harpoon also works but is a strictly worse version of the Infernal Harpoon.
